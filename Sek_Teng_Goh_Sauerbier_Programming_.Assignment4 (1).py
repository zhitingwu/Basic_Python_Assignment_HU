The ‘Faculty’ page at the website for the Berlin School of Mind and Brain 
lists the school’s current faculty members. The purpose of the program
is to retrieve the details of faculty members from the current version of the 
web page and saves their information into a spreadsheet file. 

For each faculty member, all of the information that is displayed in their 
detail view (Function, Current status, Research area, etc.) are saved
in the CSV file, except for their phone number and email address.
